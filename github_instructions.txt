# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter a repository name (e.g., "nifi-webcrawler-processor")
3. Add a description: "A custom Apache NiFi processor for recursively crawling REST APIs using a Depth-First Search approach"
4. Choose visibility (public or private)
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (as we already have these files)
6. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions. Use the section titled "...or push an existing repository from the command line"

Run these commands in your terminal (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify the upload
1. After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your project files listed
3. The README.md will be rendered on the main page

## Next steps
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD if needed
- Add collaborators to your repository
- Create issue templates
- Set up branch protection rules

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter authentication issues when pushing:
- Try using SSH instead of HTTPS
- Use a personal access token for HTTPS authentication
- Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for easier authentication
